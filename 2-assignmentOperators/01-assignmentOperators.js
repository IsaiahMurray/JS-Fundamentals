// Assignment Operator
let r = 5;

// Addition assignment Operator
r = r + 1;
r += 2; //increment by two and reassign the value of r to it
r++; //increment by one(and only one)

// Subtraction Assignment operator
r -= 7; //decrement by seven then reassign the value of r to it
r--; //decrement by one(and only one)

// Multiplication Assignment Operator
r *= 10; //multiply by ten then reassign the new value to r

// Division Assignment Operator
r /= 3; //dividing by threes

//Exponent Assignment Operator
r **= 3; //raise to the third power then reassign the new value to r
3 ** 2; //raise to the second power then reassign the new value to r

//Modulus Assignment Operator
r %= 5; //divides by the number(5) then returns the remainder
